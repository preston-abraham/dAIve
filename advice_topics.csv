1,I’m 47 and debt-free. Do you think I should stop making contributions to my 401(k) account for an entire year in order to save up an emergency fund? I'm fully funding the 401k and I get a full match?! Why the heck would I do that and miss out on the match and the interest gained?,"I recommend that people put off or stop investing until they are debt-free, except for their home, and have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses in place. Here’s the way I look at it. If you have no emergency fund, but you’re contributing to your 401(k), there’s a good chance you’ll end up cashing out your 401(k) if a large, unexpected expense comes along. When you cash out a 401(k) early, you get hit with a penalty plus your tax rate. That’s not a good plan! ",['investing']
2,"I have a mortgage that will be paid off in the next two years with no problem, should I pay extra toward the house or invest that money over and above the 15% you recommend putting toward retirement since I will have it paid off soon and can take advantage of two years of interest in my mutual funds?","I would pay extra on the house. You know, a magical thing happens when you pay down a house and sell it somewhere down the road. The money comes back. You didn’t lose it. Honestly, you’re not doing a bad thing by putting it into retirement either. But you don’t know exactly what will happen over the next several years of your life or the life of your investments. You might think you know. You might even have a plan. But the truth is even the best plans don’t always work out the way we want. And if that happens, it sure would be neat to own your home outright!

3,"I know Dave teaches in Baby Step 4 to save 15% towards retirement. My company matches what I save, so does the total of what I'm saving and what they match equal the 15%?","Nope. Ramsey Solutions teaches in Baby Step 4 to save 15% towards retirement. No. we consider that a ""bonus"" (or icing on the cake).

It's going to help you establish the habit of being intentional and preparing for later…especially if the job and/or match goes away.",['investing']
4,Why should I start with the smallest debt instead of the highest interest rate?,"Personal finance is only 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior. Pay off the smallest debts first in order to get some quick wins emotionally. It is the same concept as if you were on a diet and you lose weight in the very first week. Now you are motivated to stay on the diet. If you don’t lose any weight, it’s back to the bear claws and milkshakes. ",['debt snowball']
5,Is it okay to buy furniture or appliances using a rent-to-own plan? ,"No. RTO places promise low monthly or weekly payments, but you'll always end up paying much more than if you saved up and bought the item outright. ",['debt']
6,My fiancé and I are planning to be married in less than a year. We both have debt. Should we wait to have the wedding until we're both debt-free? ,"No. When two people know they really love each other, they should get married whenever they feel in their hearts the time is right. At this point, you shouldn’t be thinking about money as anything except an indicator of where you’re going. It doesn’t matter who got into debt or how, because everyone makes mistakes. But if you’re both serious about getting out of debt, living on less than you make, and are in agreement about how the dollars are going to be handled, then — where money is concerned — you’re ready to be married. ",['marriage']
7,How about having a baby? Should you wait until your debt is paid off? ,"No. If you let money determine whether or not you have kids, you might never have them. It would be just as crazy to let any of your money goals determine your baby timeline: ""We’ll have kids when we’re investing in retirement, or when we’re able to fund their college educations, or when the house is paid off."" Children are worth more than any amount of money, so if you want to be a parent and you and your spouse are ready in every other way, don’t let debt stop you.",['kids']
8,"A debt collector has been calling members of my family for the last two weeks to get information on me. He DID identify himself as a collector, AND I want to pay what I owe, but is it legal for him to do this?","No, it isn’t legal. If he identified himself in any way as a debt collector, and spoke with anyone but you about your debt, he broke the law. This is a violation of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. You need to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against this collector and his company.",['debt collection']
9,Are credit cards and student loans “secured debts” or “unsecured debts”?,"They are ""unsecured debts""…which means you were loaned money, but there isn't a lien on anything. Meaning there's nothing that can directly be repossessed if the borrower doesn't pay. (However, they can sue you eventually, and then get a lien against something AFTER they win a lawsuit.). A home mortgage loan and a car loan are examples of ""secured debt"". If you don't pay, they can foreclose and take the house. The same is true with a car loan. If you don’t make the payments, they can take the car. Side note: If you're in financial trouble, you’d make the car payment before paying on your student loan, and you’d make your house payment before paying on a credit card.",['credit cards']
10,"I’m 29, and I have no debt. I’ve gotten a good start on my savings and retirement, too. My girlfriend and I are getting married in the next couple of years, and she has about \$90,000 in debt. I’m not paying on her debt yet, but I think together we can save up enough to pay it off by the time we’re married. Should I temporarily slow down saving for a house and start saving toward paying off her debt?","Yes, I would have a “girlfriend debt” account. That way when she becomes your wife, you two can write a check the moment you get back from the honeymoon and be debt-free — or at least knock out a huge portion of the debt. After that, the two of you — as in WE — resume saving for retirement, a house and so on.",['marriage']
11,"My wife and I are currently in Baby Step 2 and paying off all our debt except for our home. Is it wise to pay off everything except for the credit card debt, IF we know that we can settle for a far less amount and not have so much money going out the door? It would also cut the time it would take to be totally debt-free in half. Is this ok?","NO. It's unethical. It's dishonorable to not pay a bill you're morally and legally obligated to pay. If you're able to pay your bills, you pay your bills. Now, if you honestly can't every pay the bill and you have to settle upon a mutually agreed amount w/ the creditor or collector, then it's ok at that point to try to reach a settlement. Otherwise, it's a simple question of ethics. Pay the bill!",['debt snowball']
12,"My wife and I aren’t seeing eye-to-eye on a motorcycle. The bike was my dad’s, and I got it four years ago when he passed away. I’d like to keep it because I grew up riding it with him, and I still ride it today. My wife thinks we should sell it to pay off debt. We make about \$60,000 a year, and we have about \$36,000 to go before we’re debt-free except for our home. The bike is worth about \$2,300. Should I sell it?","There’s no way I’d sell that bike. If it were just a miscellaneous motorcycle, I’d sell the thing in about 20 seconds. But this bike is unique and special because it was your dad’s. There’s only one of those in the world.  It’s like a lady in the same scenario saying she has a \$2,300 diamond on her hand that’s her wedding ring. Would I tell her to sell it? No way! This bike is very much woven into the fabric of your life and your fondest memories. As a rule, you just don’t sell things like that. Now, there may be extreme cases sometimes where a person might have to consider selling something of that magnitude. If you were in a truly awful situation making \$10,000 a year and the ring is worth \$200,000 while you’re \$100,000 in debt, you’d have to give it some thought. But there’s no way I’d sell that bike in your case!",['']
13,"My wife and I got our starter emergency fund of \$1,000 in the bank, and we’re busy paying off credit cards and unpaid taxes from previous years (\$18k total debt). We're also saving up cash to take a vacation this summer. Any advice on how to pay down this debt faster? ","Skip the vacation and use the cash towards the debt. The reason people are successful following my plan is because I teach common sense combined with an unbridled, scorched-earth kind of intensity. Let’s take a closer look at this. You have unpaid taxes, not to mention credit card debt hanging over your heads, and you're talking about going on a trip? I’m sorry, but that’s completely irresponsible. ",['debt snowball']
14,"My wife and I have just started getting on track with our money. We have \$2,000 in savings (including starter EF), and the only debt we have is our house and two cars. I work in the oil and gas industry and make about \$180,000 a year, but things are pretty volatile right now. We’re upside down on both vehicles (we owe \$39,000 on one and about \$48,000 on the other). Under the circumstances, should we go ahead and build a fully funded emergency fund or work on paying off the cars?","Sell the cars, dude! You need to go to Kelly Blue Book’s website right now and find out what your cars are really worth. Then, put them on the market as a private sale. You’ll get thousands more selling them that way than you will at a dealership. You’ll have to talk to a local credit union or bank for a small loan to cover the difference, plus a little bit more so you guys can get a couple of little beaters to drive for a while. But man, you’ve got close to \$100,000 in car debt hanging over your heads. That’s a disaster! I want you to take a moment and think about how things would be without these stinking car payments. Your lives would change completely! Hopefully, you’ll be able to keep your job. But this car debt is the scariest thing I’ve heard in a long time, even with your great income. Get rid of those things now!",['upside-down']
15,"My wife and I are recent graduates with advanced degrees. We also have about \$300,000 in student loan debt. We know you're a rental property fan, so we’re thinking about buying a rental property, and the plan is to get a mortgage with monthly payments of \$400 and charge \$800 in rent. We could use the extra to help pay off our debt. Do you think this is a good idea?","Are you serious?! You're in a financial crisis and you're asking if it's ok to buy rental property?! You should not buy a rental property. Even if you did, this plan assumes that it’s constantly occupied, and the renter actually pays. Those are two pretty big assumptions. Use whatever money you have to get out of debt, and live simple, inexpensive lives until you get this behind you. Stop trying to borrow your way through all of your dreams. Doing that will only turn those dreams into nightmares!",['debt snowball']
16,Are rent-to-own plans ok? ,"I don’t recommend rent-to-own scenarios when it comes to buying a home, either. Most of those offerings are listed at full retail price and then some. Plus, the contracts are tilted toward the seller’s side of the equation. And very few people who sign a rent-to-own home deal follow through and become homeowners. When it comes to real estate deals, the only thing I would consider — other than an outright cash purchase — is leasing with an option to buy. That’s different than rent-to-own, because in a rent-to-own situation you’ve committed to the purchase. On a lease with an option to buy deal, you have the right to purchase, but not the obligation. Most of the people who use rent-to-own deals are not in good financial shape. They’re deeply in debt, and they have no money. Rent-to-own ensures they’ll stay there. ",['rent-to-own']
17,What is wrong with Zero Percent Interest?,"We just finished an extensive study of more than 10,000 millionaires. Not a single one of these folks said they became rich by borrowing money to buy things at zero percent interest. We know banks charge interest on loans, so how is it you think they’re loaning money at “zero percent interest? “Is it possible the pricing of the item has the interest rate built into it? I think the chances of that are pretty high. In addition, companies offering this kind of financing have highly researched data that tells them the vast majority of people who take out zero percent loans don’t pay them off in the specified period of time. What happens if you don’t live up to the terms of those contracts? It becomes a regular loan, and they back charge you for the interest. So, on average you’re paying for it all. I don’t know why you’d want to play with snakes. Snakes bite. And debt destroys your most powerful wealth-building tool—your income. ",['zero interest']
18,"I have a debt with a collection agency, and they have started calling my office. Last week, I made an agreement for monthly payments, along with an initial payment. All of a sudden, they were calling me again this morning at my office. What can I do legally? What's the process of getting them to stop?","I’m glad you’re keeping in mind that you have a legal and moral obligation to pay your debts. But collectors have rules they must follow, also. They’re governed by law just like everyone else. If they call you at work again, simply remind them of the terms of the payment agreement already in place and demand that they never call you at your office again. Also, send them a certified letter, return receipt requested, so that you’ll have proof you sent the letter and they received it. In the letter, let them know that according to guidelines set forth in the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act you are formally demanding that they not call you at your office again. If they call you at your office after you demand that they stop, they’ll be in violation of federal law. And if that happens, let them know that you’ll be talking to a lawyer, and you will sue them!",['debt collection']
19,"What's the difference between Chapter 7, Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 bankruptcies?"," Chapter 7: A trustee is appointed to liquidate nonexempt assets to pay creditors; after the proceeds are exhausted, the remaining debt is discharged. There are eligibility requirements to file Chapter 7, such as the debtor must have had no Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged in the preceding eight years and the applicant must pass a means test. This process is also known as a straight or liquidation bankruptcy. Chapter 11: Chapter 11 is a form of bankruptcy that involves a reorganization of a debtor's business affairs, debts, and assets. Named after the U.S. bankruptcy code 11, corporations generally file Chapter 11 if they require time to restructure their debts. This version of bankruptcy gives the debtor a fresh start. However, the terms are subject to the debtor's fulfillment of his obligations under the plan of reorganization. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is the most complex of all bankruptcy cases. It is also usually the most expensive form of a bankruptcy proceeding. Chapter 13: Also known as the ""wage earner plan"" enables individuals with a regular income to restructure their obligations to repay their debt over time. In such a plan, the debtor does not seek to earn general forgiveness of their outstanding debts. Rather, the debtor offers up a repayment plan that utilizes fixed installment payments. Such payments are made to a trustee who then forwards them to the creditor for a specified period, usually three to five years.",['bankruptcy']
20,How long does a bankruptcy stay on your credit report and besides that what are any other long-term effects of declaring bankruptcy? Seems like an easy way out.,"One of the biggest aftershocks of filing bankruptcy is that it stays on your credit report for years afterward. A Chapter 7 and 11 filing stays on your credit report for 10 years. Chapter 13 up to seven years.Another big problem is that it can follow you around when it comes to applications or when you apply for different types of licenses. Many of these ask if you’ve ever filed bankruptcy. It doesn’t ask if it’s still on your credit report; it will ask if you’ve ever filed bankruptcy. If you have, you’ll have instances for the rest of your life when you have to admit it and explain it all over again. So, it’s an emotional scar that follows you around for a long, long time. It also becomes public domain. Plus…Both federal and private student loans are more difficult to discharge in bankruptcy than other types of debt.  Too many bankruptcy filers never really recover from their financial distress because they never learn new and better ways to manage their money. That’s why I recommend people do everything they can to avoid bankruptcy. It’s not an easy do-over; it’s a last-resort kind of thing. And in the vast majority of situations, it’s just not necessary.",['bankruptcy']

23,When is the right time to buy a house in the Baby Steps?,"  Baby Step 1 is saving \$1,000 for a beginner emergency fund.

I’ll call it Baby Step 3b. For folks looking to buy a house, I advise saving enough money for a down payment of at least 20 percent. I don’t beat people up over mortgage debt, but I do advise them to get a 15-year, fixed rate loan, where the payments are no more than 25 percent of their monthly take-home pay. When saving up for a home down payment we’re talking a matter of months to one- or two-years tops—not a five-year detour. You don’t want to lose momentum for that long.

43,How does an interest-only mortgage work and would you ever consider one?,"An interest-only mortgage is just what it sounds like. You’re paying only the interest on the loan, and none of what you actually owe. The borrower only pays the interest on the mortgage through monthly payments for a term that is fixed. An interest-only mortgage never reduces the principal balance. The loan balance will actually remain unchanged unless the borrower pays extra. It’s a good way to stay in debt for the rest of your life, so they’re not a good idea. Lots of people look at this product and say, “Wow, I’ll get a lower monthly payment, and then I can throw tons of cash at the principal.” Guess what, in most cases it doesn’t work out that way. Why not take out a good 15-year fixed rate mortgage and put a bunch of money toward the principal? Everyone thinks they have a great idea for tricking the system. But the only system that really works is to pay off debt as quickly as you can. Interest-only mortgages are like adjustable-rate mortgages and high fixed rate mortgages — they’re good things to stay away from completely! ",['mortgage']
44,"I'm about to purchase my first house and I keep hearing the word ""Escrow"" come up. What is ""Escrow""?","Escrow is the process when a neutral, third party is in charge of holding something of value—usually cash—until a transaction between a buyer and seller is complete.  The main job of escrow is to ensure a fair and smooth real estate deal from beginning to end.  If you’re a home buyer or seller, being in escrow means different things:As a buyer, escrow starts when the seller accepts your offer.  You agree to pay a percentage of the price of the property into escrow for safekeeping. This is a small percentage of the sale price of the house (between 1-2%) which you'll make payable to the escrow provider.  They'll hang on to your money until the sale is final.As a seller, you agree to take the house off the market while it’s in escrow and make it available for inspections.When you finally get to closing day, the earnest money will be subtracted from the amount you owe the seller and put toward the deposit or closing costs. If for any reason the seller doesn’t make an agreed-upon repair by the closing date, then money can be held from them in escrow to cover the cost to you. And if the deal falls through? Don’t worry: You’ll get your earnest money back minus a small cancellation fee. ",['']
45, A friend recommended a Subprime Mortgage. Can you explain how they work? ,"A subprime mortgage is a housing loan given to people with less-than-perfect credit. They were designed to bring the American Dream of homeownership within everyone’s reach.  The biggest difference between a conventional and subprime mortgage is the interest rate. Because a subprime borrower poses a greater threat to the lender, the lender charges a higher interest rate per month. This means, in the long run, you’ll pay more for your house than you would through a conventional mortgage. ",['mortgage']
46,How about an Interest Only Mortgage? Can you tell me how those work?," An interest-only mortgage requires you to pay only interest for a fixed amount of time, usually somewhere between 5 and 10 years. If you’re paying only interest, your monthly payments will be much lower than the payment on a conventional mortgage—lower, sure, until the interest-only time frame ends.Once the time frame ends, you’ll have to pay interest and your loan balance. And here’s the catch: you won’t get extra time to pay off your mortgage. So, if you took out a 15-year mortgage, with a 5-year interest-only time frame, you have 10 years to pay the entire loan balance plus interest!",['']
47,My parents are considering a Reverse Mortgage.  Does Dave EVER recommend a Reverse Mortgage? How does a Reverse Mortgage work? Is there an age limit?,"NO!  A reverse mortgage is a type of loan that uses your home equity to provide the funds for the loan itself.  It’s basically a chance for retirees to tap into the equity they’ve built up over many years of paying their mortgage and turn it into a loan for themselves. With a reverse mortgage, you don’t make payments on your home’s principal like you would with a regular mortgage—you take payments from the equity you’ve built. The bank is lending you back the money you’ve already paid on your home but charging you interest at the same time. For some folks, the appealing part of a reverse mortgage is that you don’t make any monthly payments to the lender or pay the interest until you sell your home.Problem is…If you die before you’ve sold your home, those you leave behind are stuck with two options. They can either pay off the full reverse mortgage and all the interest that’s piled up over the years or surrender your house to the bank.  So, it might seem like a reverse mortgage is a helpful cash-flow option for people in their retirement, but these mortgages put seniors and their heirs at financial risk.It’s only available to homeowners who are 62 or older and is aimed at folks who have paid off their mortgage (or most of it anyway). ",['mortgage']
48,What is Capital Gains Tax?,"A capital gains tax is a tax on the profit realized on the sale of a non-inventory asset.  It's assessed on the positive difference between the sale price of the asset and its original purchase price. The most common capital gains are realized from the sale of stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate, and property. Long-term capital gains tax is a levy on the profits from the sale of assets held for more than a year. The rates are 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your tax bracket. Short term capital tax applies to assets held for a year or less and is taxed as ordinary income.Here's how it can work. A single taxpayer who purchased a house for \$200,000 and later sells his house for \$500,000 had made a \$300,000 profit on the sale. After applying the \$250,000 exemption from his bracket, he must report a capital gain of \$50,000, which is the amount subject to the capital gains tax. In most cases, significant repairs and improvements can be added to the base cost of the house, thus reducing even more the amount of taxable capital gain.",['tax']
49,"What is a ""Short Sale"" in Real Estate?","A short sale is when a homeowner sells his or her property for less than the amount owed on their mortgage.

Should we try setting up a payment plan with the hospital, or is dipping into emergency fund a better idea?","I’d write a check today and knock out that hospital bill.

You always recommend term insurance, but how much coverage should we get if we already have two kids and plan for more? And what happens when the term ends?","Generally, I recommend 15- or 20-year level term policies—unless you have children. Since you have children and want to grow a family, I’d advise 30-year term policies. You’ll want the insurance there to protect everyone in the family, until the kids are grown and out on their own. In the years after, continued saving and wealth building will lead you to a point where you’re both self-insured (that's the goal for when the term ends).","['kids', 'insurance']"
56,"Can you please explain the difference between Term Insurance and Whole Life Insurance, as far as how they work."," Term life insurance provides life insurance coverage for a specific amount of time. If you or your spouse passes away at any time during this term (usually 20–30 years), your beneficiaries (those you’ve selected to inherit your money) will receive a payout from the term life insurance policy. Term life insurance plans are much more affordable than whole life insurance. This is because the term life policy has no cash value until you or your spouse passes away. In the simplest of terms, it’s not worth anything unless one of you were to die during the course of the term. Then that’s when you receive money. Of course, the hope here is you’ll never have to use your term life insurance policy at all—but if something does happen, at least you know your family will be taken care of.The premiums on whole life insurance (sometimes called cash value insurance) are generally more expensive than term life for a couple of reasons. Whole life coverage lasts throughout your entire lifetime. You might think it’s a good thing to have life insurance coverage for your entire life. But here’s the truth: If you practice the principles we teach, you won’t need life insurance forever. Ultimately, you’ll be self-insured. Why? Because you’ll have zero debt, a full emergency fund and a hefty amount of money in your investments.Whole life insurance costs more because it’s designed to build cash value. But keep in mind that a life insurance policy shouldn’t be an investment or money-making scheme—it’s simply meant to provide security, protection and peace of mind for your family should the unthinkable happen. Life insurance has one job: It replaces your income when you die. There are far more productive and profitable ways to invest your money than using your life insurance plan. ",['']

115,What is a 401(k)?,"A 401(k) is a tax-advantaged, employer-sponsored retirement savings plan companies offer as a benefit to help their employees save for retirement. Most employers match the money employees put into their 401(k)s up to a certain percentage of the employee’s income. There are two types of 401(k)s: Traditional and Roth. ",['']
116,What is a Traditional 401(k)?,"A traditional 401(k) allows employees to have their retirement contributions taken out of their paychecks before taxes. Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning the money that goes in is not taxed until the employee withdraws that money (usually in retirement).  ",['']
117,What is a Roth 401(k)?,"A Roth 401(k) is different from the traditional 401(k) because it is funded with after-tax dollars, which means employee contributions are taxed before they go into the account. The money in a Roth 401(k) also grows tax-free, so employees can enjoy tax-free investment growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It’s hard to beat tax-free growth and withdrawals, so we recommend you use all the Roth options available to you. And, if your plan offers good growth stock mutual funds with a history of outperforming the stock market, and you’re on Baby Step 4, you can invest your entire 15% in your Roth 401(k).",['']
118,What is a 403(b)?,"A 403(b) plan is a tax-advantaged retirement account for certain employees of public schools and tax-exempt organizations. Similar to the 401(k), 403(b) plans offer tax advantages (like tax-deferred contributions or tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement) for teachers, school administrators, professors, government employees, nurses, doctors, and librarians. ",['']
119,What is a 457?,"A 457 plan is a non-qualified, tax-advantaged, deferred compensation retirement plan offered by state governments, local governments, and some nonprofit employers to their employees. Eligible participants can make pre-tax contributions that grow tax-free until the money is withdrawn in retirement. There are also Roth 457s that allow employees to invest with after-tax dollars.",['']
120,What is an Annualized Rate of Return?,The annualized rate of return calculates the rate of return for an investment by averaging returns on an annual basis. It’s different from the annual return because it accounts for the compounding of investment earnings over time.,['']
121,What are annuities?,"Often marketed as a financial product, an annuity is basically a contract between you and an insurance company designed to provide you a guaranteed income for the rest of your life or over a set period of time. You make a payment (or payments) to an insurance company, and, in return, they promise to grow that money and send you payments during retirement.",['']
122,What are annuities?,"Often marketed as a financial product, an annuity is basically a contract between you and an insurance company designed to provide you a guaranteed income for the rest of your life or over a set period of time. You make a payment (or payments) to an insurance company, and, in return, they promise to grow that money and send you payments during retirement.    There are two types of annuities. Fixed and Variable. Fixed are typically 5% or less and fixed. Fixed annuities are not a good place to park money long term because they hardly keep up with inflation. Variable annuities are fine for use in Baby Step 7 only because they have mutual funds you can pick inside them. Most of them have mutual fund fees AND annuity fees so they are more expensive than buying the same mutual funds direct. But, they have three features a stand-alone mutual fund does not have:   Guaranteed minimum rate of return around 5-7% if you leave it alone 5-7 years. People who are scared of the stock market often love this feature, however the percentage of mutual funds that would perform that badly over that period is miniscule.   Guaranteed Principal Protection for the original investment amount if you leave it alone for 5-7 years. Again, people who are scared love this, but the number of funds that perform this badly is miniscule.   Named Beneficiary. All annuities are technically insurance products sold by insurance companies so a beneficiary can be named. This is great for estate planning because this money passes to the beneficiary outside of probate tax and outside the control of the will.   Note: As stated Fixed Annuities are through insurance companies and can be sold by anyone with a life insurance license so they become a backdoor way for a life insurance salesman to sell mutual funds without being securities licensed. Consequently, most of our questions are from a listener getting this pitch for retirement from someone who can’t sell them mutual funds directly. And they are usually misusing this product. So, send them to SmartVestor who can also sell the same thing OR Mutual Funds whichever is best for them. We teach never do these until Baby Step 7 and maybe not even then. Dave doesn’t own them.",['']
123,What are bonds?,"A bond is a type of loan between an investor and a business or government. When you buy a bond, you’re lending the business or government money, and they promise to pay you back with interest at a certain date (at “maturity).  Bonds are also called “fixed-income securities,” and companies and governments use the money from the bonds they issue to pay for projects or expansion. ",['']
124,What are CDs?,"A certificate of deposit (CD) is a special kind of savings account that comes with a fixed interest rate. Basically, it’s like giving a bank or credit union a loan from your own pocket. In exchange for lending them a lump sum of your money for a fixed amount of time, they agree to pay you interest until the CD “matures” (that’s the term banks use for when a CD reaches its end date).",['']
125,What is Compound Interest/Growth?,"Compound interest is when your money earns interest on top of interest. $100 in a savings account that earns 10% interest each year will grow to $110 the first year and $121 the second year. It grows more the second year because the $10 in interest from the first year also earns interest.  Over time, compound interest (and your money) builds exponentially. Accounts that earn interest (savings, money markets, CDs) earn compound interest. Investments, like mutual funds, do not earn interest, but the growth of those investments’ compounds, leading to exponential growth over time.",['']
126,What is Cryptocurrency?,"Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual assets people use as investments and for online purchases. Cryptocurrencies (there are many types) are decentralized—which means no government or bank controls how they’re made, what their value is, or how they’re exchanged. Instead, they use cryptography and blockchain technology to validate transactions and make it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend",['']
127,What is a Deferred Compensation Plan?,"A deferred compensation plan sets aside some of your salary through payroll deductions for you to use sometime in the future, usually retirement. The lump-sum owed to an employee in this type of plan is paid out on a specific date or over a period of time after that specific date. In most cases, contributions to deferred compensation plans are tax-deferred, making them very popular with high-income earners who want to lower their taxable income. Examples of deferred compensation plans include pensions, retirement plans, and employee stock options. ",['']
128,What are Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)?,"An exchange traded fund (ETF) is an investment that basically is a cross between a mutual fund and stock. They are funds that can contain stocks, commodities, bonds, or a combination of different types of investments; and they are traded on an exchange, just like single stocks",['']
129,What are Index funds?,Index funds are mutual funds designed to mirror the performance of the stock market or a particular area of the stock market. Most index funds track an index like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average and include stocks from companies that are included in those indices. Index funds often have lower fees since they are not actively managed. ,['']
130,What is an Individual Retirement Account (IRA)?,An IRA (aka individual retirement account) is a retirement account that allows you to save a certain amount each year for retirement with some tax advantages. There are two types of IRAs—traditional and Roth. ,['']
131,What is a traditional IRA?,"Traditional IRAs allow investors to make deposits into their accounts with pretax dollars, which means you will get a tax deduction on your contribution and pay income tax when you withdraw the money from the account during retirement. ",['']
132,What is a Roth IRA?,"Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, which means your contributions are not tax-deductible. But the money inside the account grows tax-free and you won’t be taxed on your withdrawals in retirement.",['']
133,What is Micro-Investing?,"Micro-investing is an investing strategy where you regularly invest small amounts of money. Micro-investing platforms make it easy to save a little here and there. Many will automatically round up your purchases and put the spare change into your investments or make automatic transfers and invest your money for you. You also don’t need a large initial investment to get started. The downside is that micro-investing leads to micro results. If that’s all you’re doing to build wealth for retirement, you won’t have enough saved to replace your income when you retire.",['']
134,What is a Money Market Account?,A money market account is a type of savings account that normally pays a higher rate of interest than a savings account. It keeps your money safe and sound and gives you more access to your account than a typical savings account (think checks and debit cards). You’ll probably also need to make a higher initial deposit or keep a higher monthly balance in your money market account.,['']
135,What is a Money Market Fund?,"A money market fund is a type of mutual fund invested in short-term debt securities. Short-term debt securities are just a fancy way to say money loaned to governments, corporations and banks that’s due back to investors in less than a year, plus interest. In this case, you are the lender, and they are the borrower. Money market funds are in the family of fixed-income investments, which means they’re designed to give investors a steady stream of income on a regular basis in the form of interest payments.",['']
136,"What are mutual funds, and what are the different types?","Mutual funds are a type of investment   that allow investors to pool their money together to invest in things like stocks, bonds, money markets, and other assets. Dave recommends spreading your investments evenly between four specific types of growth stock mutual funds:     Aggressive growth—Aggressive growth funds—sometimes called small cap funds—are the ""wild child"" of mutual funds. When they’re up, they are really up, but when they’re down—watch out! Made up of stocks from companies with a lot of potential for growth (like small tech start-ups or large companies in emerging markets), they’re your chance to take a big risk for a potentially bigger financial reward.     Growth—Growth funds are invested in medium to large companies that still have room to grow. You’ll sometimes see these funds listed as mid cap funds. Even though they have a knack for rising and falling with the economy, growth funds are pretty stable overall and usually earn higher returns than growth and income funds.    Growth and income—Growth and income funds, sometimes called large cap funds, are mostly made up of stocks from big companies—including some you’ll probably recognize, like Apple or Microsoft—that are valued over $10 billion. They’re more predictable and the calmest type of funds available. Although their returns aren’t always as high as other funds, they’re what many consider to be a low-risk, stable foundation for your portfolio.    International—International funds are great because they spread your risk beyond U.S. soil and invest in big non-U.S. companies you know and love like Toyota, Samsung and Nestlé. You may see these referred to as foreign or overseas funds. Just don’t get them confused with world or global funds, which group U.S. and foreign stocks together.",['']
137,What is a pension?,"A pension is a retirement plan where an employer makes contributions to a retirement account for each of their employees. When the employees retire, they get a fixed payout each month or one lump sum amount. How much you get depends on how long you worked for the company and the salary you had. Think of it like a retirement account that your employer funded instead of you. Most businesses have moved away from pension plans (also called defined contribution plans) in favor of 401(k) plans.",['']
138,What is the difference in Pre-Tax vs Post-Tax contributions?,"In retirement investing, a pre-tax contribution is a deposit made into an investment account with money that has not been taxed yet. Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you will have to pay taxes on the contributions and any growth when you use the money in retirement (which is why these contributions are also referred to as tax-deferred). Common pre-tax investment accounts include the traditional 401(k) and IRA, 403(b), and 457 plan.       Post-tax contributions are deposits made with money that has already been taxed. Because taxes have already been paid, you won’t have to pay taxes on any growth or withdrawals in retirement (which is why these contributions are also referred to as tax-free). Common post-tax investment accounts include the Roth IRA and Roth 401(k).",['']
139,What is Robo-Investing?,"Robo-investing (or “robo-advising”) is a form of do-it-yourself investing that lets you invest on digital platforms that provide automated financial planning services based on algorithms and little to no human supervision. A typical robo-advisor collects information from clients about their financial situation, tolerance for risk, and future goals and then uses that data to offer advice and make automatic investments for on their behalf.",['']
140,What is a SIMPLE IRA?,"A SIMPLE IRA plan (aka Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) is basically a start-up retirement savings plan for small businesses (usually no more than 100 employees). A SIMPLE IRA makes it easy for small-business owners to save for their own retirement and contribute to their employees’ retirement savings as well.   Employees and their employers put money into a traditional IRA set up by the business.  Your plan’s provider offers investment options to choose from, and each employee is free to pick which ones to include in their own SIMPLE IRA.   Participants decide how much of each paycheck they want to contribute to their account and. Contributions are tax deferred.  Employer contributions are mandatory for SIMPLE IRAs. Most employers choose to match employee contributions up to 3% of their salary.",['']
141,What is a Simplified Employee Pension IRA?,A Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan lets self-employed people and small businesses create tax-deferred retirement savings plans that work like traditional IRAs. Employers make tax-deductible contributions on behalf of eligible employees. That’s one big difference from other retirement plans—only the employer contributes to the plan. And contributions are immediately vested—meaning it’s your money from day one.,['']
142,What are Single stocks?,"Stocks represent shares (or tiny pieces) of a company. When a company goes public, they sell these small shares to investors to pay for business growth initiatives. When you buy stocks, you actually become a part owner of the company. Buying stocks is one of the most common investment strategies. Over time, the value of the stock will (hopefully) grow and produce a return on your initial investment. The value of any given stock is tied to the performance of the company and how it is perceived by consumers. Because of that, some stocks are more volatile than others, meaning that their price rises and falls quickly. Buying stocks always carries risk. If the company goes south, you could lose all the money you invested. ",['']
143,What are Taxable Investment Accounts (or “Brokerage Accounts”)?,"Taxable investment accounts—also known as brokerage accounts—allow you to invest in things like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Unlike tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, taxable investment accounts don’t come with any tax benefits. But they do offer investors fewer restrictions and more flexibility. For example, you can withdraw your money at any time, for any reason, with no tax or penalty.",['']
144,What is a TSP (Thrift Savings Plan)?,"The Thrift Savings Plan (or TSP) gives federal workers and members of the military the opportunity to invest in a tax-advantaged account for retirement. Just like a 401(k) or 403(b), TSP contributions (which can also be Roth or traditional, by the way) can be taken straight out of your paycheck. The TSP offers five different individual fund options, each one invested in either short-term U.S. Treasury securities or U.S., international, or bond index funds.",['']

If you have debt and stop making your payments, your creditors (people who loaned you money) may place a lien (aka a claim of ownership) on your assets to recover what you owe them.    In the case of bankruptcy, you usually have to sell most of your assets to pay back your creditors.",['']
184,What is a balance?,"In the case of debt, the balance is how much you currently owe on a debt. For example, if you pay off the balance of a credit card, you no longer owe on it.

185,What is bankruptcy and what are the different types?,"A court proceeding where you tell a judge you can’t pay your debts. The judge and court trustee look through your assets and liabilities (aka what you own and what you owe) to decide whether to discharge (cancel) some of your debts. If the court finds that you really have no means to pay back your debt, you’ll go through the official process of declaring bankruptcy.   Many types of debt can’t be erased by bankruptcy: student loans, government debts like taxes, fines or penalties, child support and alimony, and expensive items (cars, boats, jewelry) purchased right before you file for bankruptcy. But bankruptcy can stop a foreclosure on your home, repossession of property or garnishment of your wages.  Bankruptcy Chapters:     Chapter 7: Also known as liquidation or straight bankruptcy, Chapter 7 is the most common type of bankruptcy for individuals. A court-appointed trustee oversees the liquidation (sale) of your assets to pay off your creditors. Any remaining unsecured debt (like credit cards or medical bills) is typically erased.    Chapter 11: This is used to reorganize a business or corporation. Businesses come up with a plan for how they’ll continue operating the company while paying off their debt. Both the court and the creditors must approve this plan. Some individuals, such as real estate investors, who have too much debt to qualify for Chapter 13, but who also have a lot of high-value properties and assets, may also choose to file under Chapter 11. But unless you’re a pro athlete or a celebrity, you’re probably not going to mess with this one.    Chapter 13: The court approves a monthly payment plan so you can pay back a portion of your unsecured debt and all of your secured debt over a period of three to five years. The monthly payment amounts depend on your income and the amount of debt you have. But the court also gets to put you on a strict budget and check all your spending. Unlike Chapter 7, this kind of bankruptcy allows you to keep your assets and catch up on any debt that isn’t bankruptable. Chapter 13 can also stop a foreclosure by giving you time to bring your mortgage up to date.     Less Common Types of Bankruptcy:     Chapter 9: This is another repayment plan that allows towns, cities, school districts, etc. to reorganize and pay back what they owe.    Chapter 12: This is a repayment plan that allows family farmers and fisherman to avoid having to sell all their stuff or foreclose on their property. While it’s similar to Chapter 13 bankruptcy, Chapter 12 is a little more flexible and has higher debt limits.    Chapter 15: This deals with international bankruptcy issues and gives foreign debtors access to U.S. bankruptcy courts.",['']

The amount of your car payment depends on how much you borrowed, how much your interest rate is and the term (how you have to pay back the loan) of your loan. Also known as a car note.",['']
192,What is collateral?,"Property (like a car, home, etc.) that a lender can take if you stop making payments on your debt. Secured debt has some form of collateral. For example, the car you purchase with a car loan acts as collateral for the loan. If you stop making payments, the lender can repossess your car and sell it to get their money back",['']
193,What is collections?,"If a borrower stops paying on their debt (typically after 3 months), it becomes delinquent debt and goes into collections. The creditor may sell your debt to a collection agency for pennies on the dollar or hire a collection agency to be their muscle and try to make you pay up.",['']

But you should never let someone cosign a loan for you, and you should never cosign a loan for someone else. Because things get messy really quick when you miss a payment and the creditors come after your relative or friend who cosigned for you.",['']
196,What is credit?,"The ability to borrow money or purchase items or services with the promise to pay back that money later, usually with added interest. Paying in cash is always better than using credit. If you can’t pay cash for something, you can’t afford it.",['']

198,What is a credit bureau?,"A credit bureau (also known as a credit reporting company or agency) is an organization that collects and researches individual credit information and sells it to creditors for a fee, so they can make decisions about granting loans. Equifax, Experian and TransUnion are the three major credit bureaus.",['']
199,What is a credit card?,"A piece of plastic (or metal, if it’s fancy) that allows the cardholder to borrow money to pay for stuff.

202,What is a credit score?,"A number (between 300–850) based on your credit history that most lenders use to decide if you seem reliable enough to pay back your debts (aka your creditworthiness). But it doesn’t factor in your actual wealth, only your debt. It’s really just an “I love debt” score that’s based on your history with borrowing money, how much debt you have, and how long you’ve had it. Below are the percentages on how the FICO Score calculated?  35% - history  30% - levels  15% - length  10% - types  10% - new",['']
203,What is Credit Worthiness?,"This refers to how reliable a lender thinks you’ll be in paying off your debt (usually based on how reliably you’ve done it in the past). But just because you’re “credit worthy,” it doesn’t mean you’re actually good with money.",['']

205,What is debt consolidation?,The process of combining several debts into one monthly bill on a streamlined payoff plan. But it typically keeps the borrower in debt even longer and usually comes with fees and higher interest rates. And it doesn’t solve the underlying behavior that leads to debt in the first place.,['']
206,What is a debt settlement?,This is when you hire a company to negotiate a lump-sum payment with your creditors for less than what you owe. But debt settlement companies can charge some crazy high fees. And you can negotiate with your creditors yourself.,['']
207,What is the debt snowball method?,"Paying off debt in order of smallest balance to largest, regardless of the interest rate.   The debt snowball (shortened):  Step 1: List your debts smallest to largest, regardless of interest rate. Pay minimum payments on everything but the little one.  Step 2: Attack the smallest debt with a vengeance. Once that debt is gone, take that payment (and any extra money you can squeeze out of the budget) and apply it to the second-smallest debt while continuing to make minimum payments on the rest.  Step 3: Once that debt is gone, take its payment, and apply it to the next-smallest debt. The more you pay off, the more your freed-up money grows and gets thrown onto the next debt—like a snowball rolling downhill.  Repeat this method as you plow your way through debt. The more you pay off, the more your freed-up money grows.    This is the best way to pay off your debt because you build momentum each time you knock out a smaller debt. The quick wins keep you motivated to pay off your debt as fast as you can.",['']
208,What is a Debt-to-income ratio or DTI?,"A banking term to explain what percentage of your income goes toward debt each month. But it doesn’t take just debt into account—it also includes rent and other reoccurring payments, like child support and alimony.

212,What is a down payment?,"The cash paid up front to buy an expensive item—like a car or house. The down payment is only a portion of the total price, which means you would have to take out a loan to finance the rest. The only time we’re okay with making a down payment, instead of paying in full, is when you buy a house. You should aim for a 10–20% down payment—20% is better to avoid PMI (private mortgage insurance). The higher your down payment, the less you have to borrow.",['']
213,What is FICO?,"he most common credit score system created by the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO). FICO is one kind of credit score, but not all credit scores are FICO. Your FICO score is calculated like this: payment history (35%), amounts owed (30%), length of credit history (15%), credit mix (10%), and new credit (10%). It’s all about your relationship to debt—not your responsibility with money. That’s why we call it an I-Love-Debt score.",['credit cards']
214,What is Forbearance?,"A way to temporarily postpone loan payments, usually for a mortgage or student loan. You can apply for forbearance if you have a financial hardship, medical expenses, change in employment or other reasons you can’t cover your loan payments. But even if your payment is put on hold, the loan continues to build up interest—which means you could end up with a higher balance than before you paused payments.",['']
215,What is garnishment>,"When part of your paycheck is sent directly to your creditor, meaning that money never hits your bank account. Creditors usually need a court order from a judge before they can garnish your wages—unless you’re behind on back taxes, child support, or federal student loans.",['']
216,What is a HELOC?,"A type of home equity loan that allows you to borrow against your home’s equity (the difference between what your house is worth and what you still owe on your mortgage). You’re basically giving up the equity you’ve earned on your home and trading it in for more debt. A HELOC is a revolving line of credit, which means you have a credit limit and you only payback what you’ve spent from the line of credit. And as you pay back what you borrowed; you can borrow more as long as you haven’t hit your credit limit. But because your house is the collateral for a HELOC, you could lose your home if you don’t pay back what you owe. Yikes!",['']
217,What is a Home Equity Loan?,"A second mortgage that allows you to borrow money against your home’s equity (your home’s current value minus what you owe on your mortgage). A home equity loan is a lump sum you pay back over time. But because your house is collateral for the loan, you could lose your home if you can’t pay it back.",['']
218,What is an interest rate?,"For borrowed money, this is the amount a lender charges for a loan. It’s a percentage of the total amount you borrow. So, If you borrow $1,000 at 10% interest, you pay back the $1,000 plus $100 in interest ($1,000 X 10% = $100) (per year).  For saved money, it’s the percentage a bank or financial institution pays you for saving money. So, if you kept $1,000 in a savings account that pays 10% interest for a year, you’d have $1,100.",['']

221,What is a line of credit?,"A type of revolving debt (like a credit card or store credit account). You have a set credit limit (which is the maximum amount you can borrow), and you have to make monthly payments on what you’ve borrowed to be able to keep spending. But if you don’t pay off your whole balance, you’ll get charged interest on what you owe.",['']
222,What is a Loan Term?,"The amount of time you have to pay back a loan. A longer term means lower monthly payments, but you’ll pay more in interest over the life of the loan—and be in debt longer.",['']
223,What is microlending?,"Small loans usually given to people in Third World countries (where normal loans aren’t available) to help them start small businesses. Microloans are issued by an individual or a group of people rather than a bank or credit union. Microlending may sound charitable in theory, but because the borrower’s credit is usually very low, microloan interest rates tend to be way above average U.S. rates. This makes it easier for individual lenders to take advantage of someone’s lack of financial knowledge. And microloans are still loans that put people in debt—which is never a good option for anyone.",['']
224,What does a minimum payment mean?,"The smallest amount you must pay on your revolving debt in order to keep borrowing money. Usually, if you only cover the minimum payment, you get charged interest on your remaining balance.",['']
225,What is a mortgage?,"A loan you get to buy a house. The best way to buy a house with 100% cash down, but a mortgage is the only kind of debt we won’t yell at you for having. We tell people to aim for a 10–20% down payment—20% if you want to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). Your monthly payment (including taxes, insurance and HOA fees) on your mortgage should be no more than 25% of your take-home pay (the amont of money that you take home after-tax that does not include insurance or investments) on a 15-year fixed-rate conventional mortgage.

226,What is a payday loan?,"A payday loan (also known as a cash advance loan or check advance loan) is a short-term loan (usually targeted at people in low-income areas) where you write a check to the lender, and they give you the same amount in cash. The lender doesn’t cash your check until your next payday. Payday lenders charge crazy fees and interest. Plus, when you pay them back, they take such a big chunk of your income, you’ll probably have to take out another payday loan to make it to your next paycheck. It’s a vicious cycle.",['']
227,What is Peer-to-Peer Lending?,"Peer-to-peer lending (also known as “social lending” or “crowd lending”), lets people take out loans directly from an individual or a group, instead of going through a bank or other financial institution. It’s super risky for the one loaning the money because it’s harder to verify the person’s ability to pay the loan back. Plus, it’s still a loan—which we never recommend.",['']
228,What is a personal loan?,"A lump sum borrowed from a bank, credit union or online lender that you have to pay back over time. People use personal loans for everything from paying for a wedding or vacation to home renovations and medical bills. It’s called a personal loan because you use the money for personal reasons—as opposed to a car loan or mortgage. It is not a loan you get from a person.",['']
229,What is Principal?,"The original amount of money borrowed in a loan. This doesn’t include the added interest. For example, if you buy a $200,000 home with a $10,000 down payment, the principal amount of your mortgage will be $190,000.",['']
230,What is repossession?,"When a lender takes back an item (collateral for a loan) that you stopped making payments on. For example, if you stop paying on your car loan, the lender can place a lien (claim of ownership) on your car and eventually take it back through a repossession. They usually sell it at auction for way cheaper than it’s worth and sue you for the difference",['']
231,What is the difference between revolving and non-revolving debt?,"Revolving debt is an open line of credit (like a credit card or store credit card). You might have a set borrowing limit (called a credit limit), and if you make the minimum payment on time and don’t exceed your limit, you can keep borrowing and spending. But if you only cover the minimum payment each month, you’ll have to pay interest on the amount you owe.     Nonrevolving debt is when you take out one lump sum (like a mortgage) and agree to an interest rate and repayment plan.",['']
232,What is Secured debt?,"With secured debt, you’re borrowing money that’s backed by a physical item. In other words, there’s collateral. It’s a lower risk for lenders because they either get your money in payments or they take back what you “bought” and sell it. So, if you have a car loan and stop making your payments, the lender will take back your car and sell it to get their money back.",['']
233,What is Tote the Note?,"Tote the note car lots (also known as buy here, pay here lots) offer financing in house, instead of sending their car buyers to third parties like banks or credit unions (which is what traditional dealers do). Interest rates are typically much higher at tote the note dealerships.",['']
234,What is unsecured debt?,"With unsecured debt, there is no collateral. Credit card debt is an example of unsecured debt. This type of debt is riskier for lenders since there isn’t anything they can take if you don’t pay—so unsecured debt often has higher interest rates to cover the lenders’ risk.",['']

Here are the main features:  It’s a tax-advantaged account that allows the beneficiary to use the money for both college and K-12 educational expenses.  Each 529 plan varies from state to state. You don’t have to use your state’s 529 plan. You can shop around and see if 529s from other states have better investment options and lower fees!  There are no annual contribution limits for a 529 plan, but you must pay federal “gift tax” if you contribute more than $15,000.    There’s no age limit for distributions (in most states). If your 32-year-old decides to go back to school, they can still use money from a 529.  There are no income restrictions for contributing to a 529.  Growth and withdrawals are not subject to federal income tax (used for qualified educational expenses, including tuition and books.    If you want to use money in a 529 plan for noneducational expenses, you can. It’s your money! But nonqualified withdrawals are taxed and hit with a 10% penalty. The person who receives the distribution pays the tax on the money taken out.  The SECURE Act, passed in December 2019, created new qualified expenses for 529 savings plans.

That’s why we say you should start your budget with giving—because when you tithe before making a plan with the rest of your money, you’re making it a priority instead of an afterthought.    Even if you’re in debt or walking through a rough financial season, tithing should still be a priority. While it’s tempting to throw that money at your debt, the discipline and faith that tithing brings are so worth it. Even while you’re paying down debt, you can still have an attitude of generosity.    While tithing 10% of your income is biblical, that doesn’t mean you have to be a Christian to tithe. It also doesn’t mean you’re a bad Christian if you don’t tithe. And guess what? God loves us when we give and when we don’t give. ",['']

Because most of the time, they have no idea what they’re getting themselves into—that’s just how they’ve been told paying for college works. 						    The stats can be overwhelming. And here‘s what makes those numbers worse: Almost 70% of high school grads will study at a four-year college, but only two-thirds of them will actually graduate with a degree.2 That means many students who take out loans leave school with nothing to show for it—except debt. That’s not okay! ",['']

And it’s actually not as difficult to save money as they might think—Foundations in Personal Finance covers plenty of creative ways to help them stack cash.    GET OUT OF DEBT: You might be thinking: They’re teenagers! What kind of debt could they possibly have? Unfortunately, debt can be a problem even for your students. Some of them might already have car payments, a credit card, or an ever-growing amount of IOU money they need to pay back to their parents or friends (yes, that counts as debt). And that can really put a damper on their future plans! That's why they need to get out of debt and stay out of debt for the rest of their lives!     PAY CASH FOR YOUR CAR: When a teenager is ready to get their own set of wheels, they need to pay with cash. That way, they won't have to worry about payments so they can focus on their next financial step. Plus, the purchase will mean even more to them and will probably inspire them to be a lot more careful on the road!    PAY CASH FOR COLLEGE: Contrary to popular belief, it is actually possible to get a college degree without taking out any student loans. If your students follow the principles taught in our curricula, they'll be able to avoid the thousands of dollars of debt that most students graduate with and start off adulthood on the right foot!

For example, if investing $50,000 of repairs into a house would increase its value to $300,000, then don’t purchase it for more than $160,000 ($300,000 x 70% = $210,000 - $50,000 = $160,000).",['house']

This is different than the mortgage term, which tells you how long you’re locked into a mortgage contract with your lender. But they play off each other—like when you do a mortgage refinance. A refinance would change your mortgage term, which could adjust your interest rate and monthly payment and therefore your amortization period.
